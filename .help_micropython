usage: install_micropython.sh [options]

The installer downloads the latest code repository to
build Micropython. Several options, some with corres-
ponding values, can be passed into the installer. These
options are outlined as follows:

-m=value, --mpy_sdk_dir=value
	Assigns the directory (relative to ./) where
	Micropython will be downloaded and installed into.

-u, --update
	Informs the installer that an updated version of
	Micropython should be downloaded.

	!!! Conflicts with -r !!!
	The latter command is executed

-r, --recompile
	Informs the installer that the Micropython firmware
	should be recompiled. This useful if you want to add
	your own code and need not doenload the latest
	version of Micropython.

	!!! Conflicts with -u !!!
	The latter command is executed

-h, --help
