usage: install_esp8266.sh [options]

This installer downloads the Xtensa code repository
and sets up the environment so that the cross-compiler
can be built. After execution, the xtensa-lx106-elf-gcc
and xtensa-lx106-elf-g++ compilers become available to
deploy code for the ESP8266. Several options, and
associated variables, exist to adjust the behavior of
the installer. These options are as follows:

-ns, --not_standalone
	With this option, the installer does not build a
	standalone compiler. This means you need to include
	all libraries manually when compiling your code.
	This can be left out as the default is to build a
	standalone cross-compiler.

-e=value, --esp_sdk_dir=value
	This allows you to define the directory into which
	the Xtensa code repository will be downloaded into
	(relative to ./). Leave as default if you do not want
	to worry about setting PATH variables manually (although
	the installer should take care of that for you).

-u, --update
	Updates the entire code repository and re-compiles
	everything.

-h, --help
